Cuisine Classifier

A Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based machine learning project that predicts the cuisine of a dish based on its ingredients list. This model helps classify recipes into various cuisine types by analyzing ingredient patterns.

🚀 Features

Predicts the cuisine of a dish based on ingredient names.
Uses NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
Implements machine learning models for classification.
Evaluates model performance using standard metrics.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python
Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)
Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (for model training)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of dishes labeled with their respective cuisines and ingredient lists.
Can be sourced from open recipe datasets or created manually.

📈 Model Performance

The model's accuracy is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
Performance metrics and confusion matrices are visualized using Matplotlib.

🔥 Future Enhancements

Fine-tuning models with deep learning (LSTMs, Transformers, etc.).
Expanding dataset with regional cuisine varieties.
Deploying the model as a REST API / Web App.
